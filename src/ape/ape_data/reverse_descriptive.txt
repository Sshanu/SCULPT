I instructed my friend to <INSERT>. The instructions looked something like this-

```
# <Heading 1>
<body>

## <Heading 1.1>
<body>
Examples: {example 1}, {example 2}

* <bullet point 1>
* <bullet point 2>
Examples: {example 1}, {example 2}, {example 3}
* <bullet point 3>

...

# <Heading 2>
* <bullet point 1>
* <bullet point 2>
...
```
The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs. Given the input and output pairs, complete the <INSERT> instruction.For each section, you can either use the same input-output pairs to write relevant examples, or you can use your best knowledge to create examples according to the observed input-output pairs. Do not use the input-output pairs directly as provided, you have to maintain the structure of the instruction intact with added examples by keeping each input text in its own in curly brackets and each curly bracketed example separated by comma, and ignore the output if the section describes labelling condition for given output label. Ensure that proper line separation is maintained for readability. Do not reproduce the tags like <body>, <bullet point 1> etc, those represent placeholder for relevant content in the instruction. Generate the output between the <INSTRUCT> and <ENDINSTRUCT> Tags.
