# Instructions to Generate a New Prompt

1. **Follow the provided structure**: Ensure the newly generated prompt follows this specific structure, using markdown formatting:
    ```
    # <Heading 1>
    <body>

    ## <Heading 1.1>
    <body>
    Examples: {example 1}, {example 2}, ...

    * <bullet point 1>
    * <bullet point 2>
    Examples: {example 1}, {example 2}, ...
    * <bullet point 3>

    ...

    # <Heading 2>
    * <bullet point 1>
    * <bullet point 2>
    ...
    ```

2. **Completely alter the structure**: While maintaining the provided format, rearrange the content layout. Use different examples, headings, and descriptions within the defined structure. The presentation should feel entirely distinct but adhere to this markdown framework.

3. **Change terminology**: Replace key terms with new vocabulary that conveys the same ideas. Invent new terms that match the task at hand while ensuring the key concepts retain their original meaning.

4. **Revise examples**: Create new examples relevant to the task but distinct from the original ones. Ensure all examples are enclosed in curly braces `{}` and are contextually aligned with the specific section of the prompt.

5. **Change the length**: The length of the new prompt can be modified. It can be very short or longer depending on your approach. You can condense or expand the instructions, as long as the core meaning is maintained.

6. **Keep the core task intact**: While everything else should feel new, the fundamental task or objective must remain the same. The goal should be clear, even though the wording and structure are fresh and unique.

## Prompt Optimization Guidelines:

* Ensure the Prompt is Vastly Different: The revised prompt must be **significantly different** from the original in its structure, phrasing, and flow, while maintaining the same output format. It is crucial that the names of the output classes or categories remain **exactly the same** as in the original.
* Limit the Number of Examples: Each section should include no more than **5-6 examples**, which must be presented as a **comma-separated list**. Ensure that all examples are directly relevant to the task at hand.
* Optimize for Length and Clarity:  The prompt must be optimized for brevity while preserving **clarity**. Use simplified language to enhance understanding and ensure the content is **concise and effective**. Additionally, **add more details where necessary** to make the instructions clearer and more comprehensive without overloading the prompt. Every added detail should contribute to the **clarity** and **precision** of the task, avoiding any unnecessary complexity.
* Establish a Clear Sequence of Steps: Organize the prompt with a **logical flow**, outlining a clear step-by-step progression to guide the user through the task. Avoid redundant information to ensure the process remains **efficient**.
* Avoid Redundancy: Remove any repetitive or unnecessary information. Each instruction and example must serve a distinct purpose, contributing to the overall **clarity and efficiency** of the prompt.
* Enhance Example Relevance: All examples must align with the task's objectives. They should provide meaningful context and must be relevant to the overall goal of the prompt.
