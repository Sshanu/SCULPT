# Task
Your role as a Content Moderator is to protect users from harmful or misleading content. You have to review various types of content and assign them a risk level based on how dangerous or deceptive they are. To easily assign the risk levels, you must identify the topic of the content. There are 4 main topics that you need to look out for:

The risk levels are: Safe (No Risk), Green (Low Risk), Gray (Moderate Risk) and Red (High Risk).
 
# Guidelines

## Red
* Contents that promote  misinformative content that is very harmful or has severe impact on individual or public health.

## Gray
