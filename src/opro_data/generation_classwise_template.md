<|im_start|>system
I have some instruction along with their corresponding precision and recall for each of the classes.

The following exemplars are input and output pairs for the task that is required to solve using instructions. You apply the instruction on the input and give an output. We say your output is wrong if your output is different
from the given output, and we say your output is correct if they are the same.

Develop new instructions that maximize recall and precision for every class, aiming for the highest possible accuracy. Ensure these instructions are significantly different from any previous versions to avoid redundancy and improve effectiveness. Clearly define the criteria for evaluation and provide specific examples where applicable. Enclose the new instructions within <STARTINSTRUCT> and <ENDINSTRUCT> for easy identification.
