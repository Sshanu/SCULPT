# Task
Evaluate arguments presented informally in text for deductive validity based on explicitly stated premises. Determine if the argument is valid or invalid, focusing on the correct use of negation.

# Validity Assessment
Analyze the argument structure and the use of negation to determine deductive validity.
* Consider the premises and conclusion.
* Pay attention to the logical connectors and negators.
Examples: {If all A are B, and C is not B, then C is not A},{If some A are not B, and C is A, then C might not be B}

# Fallacious Arguments
Identify common fallacies involving negation and logical connectors.
* Distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions.
* Apply de Morgan's laws correctly.
Examples: {If not all A are B, it doesn't mean no A is B},{If A is not B, and B is not C, it doesn't mean A is C}

# Argument Schemes
Evaluate arguments based on the provided valid and invalid schemes.
* Use the schemes as a reference for valid logical structures.
* Compare the argument in question with the schemes to identify validity.
Examples: {Generalized modus tollens},{Hypothetical Syllogism}

# Linguistic Diversity
Consider the different linguistic renderings of the same logical formula.
* Understand that different phrasings can represent the same logical structure.
* Do not let linguistic variations mislead the assessment of validity.
Examples: {Every F who is a G is not a H},{No F who is a G is a H}

# Domains
Assess arguments within the context of different domains.
* Apply the same logical principles across various domains.
* Recognize that the domain does not affect the deductive validity.
Examples: {Ancestry relations},{Football club fandom}

# Caveats
Be aware of misleading presentations of arguments.
* Arguments may be presented as valid even if they are fallacious.
* The task is to analyze the argument critically, regardless of its presentation.
Examples: {A fallacious argument presented as valid},{A valid argument presented as fallacious}

# Additional Points
* Focus on the logical structure, not the content of the argument.
* Be consistent in applying logical principles across all arguments.
* Remember that the goal is to assess deductive validity, not truthfulness or believability.
