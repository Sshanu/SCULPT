# Validity of Arguments

## Identifying Valid Arguments
Examples: {It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: First, some classmate of Sherry is not both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie. Second, being a schoolmate of Leonor is sufficient for being a half-sister of Peggy. Third, everyone who is a schoolmate of Leonor is a great-grandmother of Sophie, too. We may conclude that there is somebody who is a classmate of Sherry and not a schoolmate of Leonor.}, {It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: To start with, every infrequent user of Proactiv soap is both a regular consumer of Softsoap soap and a loyal buyer of Pureology shampoo. Now, it is not the case that Jasper is a regular consumer of Softsoap soap. In consequence, it is not the case that Jasper is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap.}, {Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To start with, if something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX, then that thing is not an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies or not an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit. Now, being an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit is necessary for not being an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101. Moreover, whatever is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 is an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies. So, necessarily, nothing is neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX.}

* Identify the premises and conclusion.
* Check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.
Examples: {Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First premise: Whatever is not an ingredient of SILKY LIP PENCIL 52 is an ingredient of Ultacover. From this follows: Nothing is neither an ingredient of Ultacover nor an ingredient of SILKY LIP PENCIL 52.}, {Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First premise: Everyone who is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is a follower of FK Kukësi, too. Second premise: No follower of FK Kukësi is a friend of Olympique de Marseille. Therefore, whoever is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.}

## Identifying Invalid Arguments
Examples: {Some football fans admire various clubs, others love only a single team. But who is a fan of whom precisely? The following argument pertains to this question: To start with, no admirer of CFR 1907 Cluj is an expert of Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC. Now, being an expert of Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC is necessary for being an ex-fan of FC Viitorul. It follows that being an admirer of CFR 1907 Cluj is necessary for not being an ex-fan of FC Viitorul.}, {Is Fred a fan of Liverpool? Are supporters of Real Madrid devotees of PSG? In European football, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the mutual admiration and dislike. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: Every supporter of Tottenham Hotspur is not an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and not a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio. Every backer of US Sassuolo Calcio who is an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit. In consequence, everyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio is a devotee of FC Zenit.}

* Identify the premises and conclusion.
* Check if the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.
Examples: {Some football fans admire various clubs, others love only a single team. But who is a fan of whom precisely? The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, nobody is neither an expert of FC Shakhtar Donetsk nor an opponent to PFC CSKA Moskva. Moreover, some opponent to PFC CSKA Moskva is not both a friend of Real Sociedad de Fútbol and an expert of FC Pyunik. Hence, there is somebody who is a friend of Real Sociedad de Fútbol, an expert of FC Pyunik, and an expert of FC Shakhtar Donetsk.}, {It is not always easy to see which chemicals are contained in our consumer products. The following argument pertains to this question: First premise: Everything that is both an ingredient of Collagen Filler Eye and an ingredient of Pinky Lip Smacker is not an ingredient of NARS Lipstick. From this follows: Not being an ingredient of NARS Lipstick is sufficient for being an ingredient of Collagen Filler Eye and an ingredient of Pinky Lip Smacker.}, {Is Fred a fan of Liverpool? Are supporters of Real Madrid devotees of PSG? In European football, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the mutual admiration and dislike. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, every opponent to FC Mariupol is an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Second, every fan of FC Utrecht is not an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or not an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen. So, necessarily, being an opponent to FC Mariupol is sufficient for not being a fan of FC Utrecht.}, {Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, Clyde is a half-brother of Darrin or a grandson of Bryan. Moreover, not being a stepbrother of Fred is sufficient for being a half-brother of Darrin and a grandson of Bryan. It follows that it is false that Clyde is a stepbrother of Fred.}
