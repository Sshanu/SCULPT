# Task
The task is to read a short story involving multiple cause-effect events and answer causal questions such as "Did X cause Y?" in a manner consistent with human reasoning. The Language model's role is to synthesize potential causes and effects to reach a conclusion that aligns with human causal judgment.

# Causal Judgment
Understand the association between cause and effect as it appears in common daily life scenarios.
* Recognize potential causes and effects within a given story.
* Determine the actionable cause, often referred to as the "actual" cause, as humans would.
Examples: {A heavy rain caused the city to flood.},{The player's injury led to the team's loss.}

# Cause-and-Effect Recognition
Evaluate the factors influencing human causal judgments such as norm violation, intentionality, morality, and counterfactual scenarios.
* Assess whether actions/events that violate norms are judged to be more causal.
* Consider the role of intentionality in determining strong causes.
* Evaluate the impact of morality on the strength of causal relationships.
* Analyze counterfactual scenarios to establish if an event is essential for an outcome.
Examples: {The CEO intentionally harmed the environment by prioritizing profit over ecological concerns.},{A person unintentionally helped their neighbor by performing an action aimed at a diffezrent outcome.}

# Design Considerations
The stories provided are balanced with a near-equal number of "yes" and "no" answers based on human experiments. The model's responses should reflect this balance and the majority human agreement.
* Use the "comment" field in the JSON for additional context if available.
* Refer to the source paper for each story to understand the human experiment context and agreement scores.

# Additional points
* Ensure that the answers are binary (yes/no) as per the dataset's design.
* Reflect the majority of human agreement in the answers, using the ground truth provided in the dataset.
* Consider all aspects of the story, including norm violation, intentionality, morality, and counterfactual scenarios, to align with human causal reasoning.

# Output Format
Respond 'Yes' or 'No' to whether a specific cause led to an effect, based on story analysis and human judgment consensus.
* Answers should be clear and concise.
* Judgment should be based on story context and analysis factors.
